	<h2>Practice Makes Perfect?<h2>
	<p>We've had dreams of owning that dream home or getting a certain car that
	you've always wanting sense a little kid. You've finally reach that 
	financial amount needed to accomplish this goal, however, there's that one 
	thing that's holding you back...your credit score.
	</p>
	<p>Credit scores in our nation is the one thing that's held people back from 
	obtaining something that they can afford. We all are signed up with some sort
	of credit company to keep track of our score each month such as Credit Karma. 
	However, the real question is do we really follow its suggestions? 
	The credit score range starts at a minimum of 300 all the way up to the maximum of 
	850. According to Experian, The U.S. average score reported at 687. The state 
	average for Georgia reported at 654. On the scale, these scores would report 
	as fair.

	<h3>How To Get Better?</h3>

		The first thing we can do to improve our score is by attacking the 
		balance that is the highest. This is a way we can slowly reduce the 
		amount that we owe in the long run. Next, paying more than the accounted
		minimum. Paying back the minimum is the least effective technique because 
		credit card companies have it set up where interest is charged (depending on 
		the Annual Percentage Rate). If you are just now establishing credit, opening 
		at least two secured credit careds, making small purchases (ex. $20 worth of gas),
		and paying it back immediately for a few months can help make your score jump.

	<h3>Does It Work?</h3>
	<section class="info">
	<div class="info-content">
		<p>
		Can this method work? Is it a fluke? Should I work with a credit repair company?
		From what I have learned from previous professionals, these methods work the 
		majority of the time. The goal is to have balances under 30 percent. 
		For example: You own a Discover credit card that is $1,200 in debt with a credit limit
		maximum of $3,000. 30% of this maximium is $900. You must pay an overall of $300 to 
		reach 30%. Hypothetically your minimum payments are set at $40 a month, but if you want 
		to reach the goal of 30%, you can make three $100 payments for three months to achieve this.
